# FlyingGame
opengl


The game requires a player to control a plane where the aim is to avoid colliding with obstacles
such as clouds and buildings. The player must control the plane’s altitude as it flies since it will
crash if left to fly by itself. The speed increases as it reaches a distance of multiples of 50. To
increase the plane’s flying altitude a player must click and hold the left key on the mouse and to
reduce the altitude, release the mouse’s left key. The game can be played by people of age 3 and
above due to the ease of control. Scores are measured based on the distance flied and levels
reached which is calculated by determining the number of times the plane’s speed has increased.
A special feature of this game is that coins can be collected mid air as the plane flies that will
increase its life to extend the gameplay. When there are no coins, and it hits an obstacle the game
is finished.
